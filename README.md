### Hello World! I'm Aziz Budiman from Sunny Singapore ðŸ‘‹

* Thank you for visiting my Github portfolio. I am a former Maths and Science teacher turned Data Analytics professional. I have worked at major companies in banking and consumer tech sectors and have leveraged key skills in Python, SQL and BI tools with enterprise level data
* My interests lies towards applications of Artificial Intelligence into real-world use cases at major industries. The rise of AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Otter.ai and copy.ai have been a potential gamechanger in daily work productivity
* I'm currently open to opportunities in the Data Science and Analytics field and constantly updating this portfolio with new content. I have recently completed an Advanced level specialization from Coursera on Practical Data Science in the AWS Cloud to gain exposure to AWS Data Science ecosystem
* I'm expanding my programming skills to other areas such as front-end web applications using the MERN Stack as well as DevOps tools such as Jenkins, Docker and Kubernetes. I'm also developing my proficiency in leveraging low-code tools such as Power Automate for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate manual and repetitive tasks on daily office applications
